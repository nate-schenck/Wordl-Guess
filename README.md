# WordlGuess

This is my first personal project using Angular and TypeScript. I've been playing the viral game Wordle often and thought it'd be fun to create an app that would give a list of possible words to guess next based on your last guessed word and its result.

## To-Do
- Add selection menu to exclude extra letters from past guesses.
- Add ability to sort the results list by # of vowels, # of consenants, A-Z, Z-A, etc.
